Welcome to my submissison for the take home test for Gemini! I'm super thankful for this opportunity and excited as well.

To run the app, run 'npm install' or 'yarn install' and then run 'npm start' or 'yarn start' in your terminal.

I did not put too much effort into styling or design into this app but focused on more on the code, functionality, and logic. 

I hope you enjoy and I look forward to hearing from you soon! 

Thank you!
